# Devs Quiz
A quiz containing questions from different programming languages. The app was built using Angular 11.X and pulls questions from JSON files that are fed to it which it then throws into a SQLite database. The quiz choice can be changed at will.

The project as things stand is still marked as incomplete in my books - I have plans of having it load everything from a firebase account and allow users to log in and keep track of their progress.

## Installation
Due to the project being incomplete/in progress I have decided to hold off on releasing it for testing or tinkering - I feel it is better to release a fully functional product that I will be happy with.

## Screenshots
The following are screenshots of how the project looks
